BeeGIS is an set of plugins for [uDig](http://udig.refractions.net) developed to be used by geologists on outdoor surveys, but can serve other professionals in different works requiring a simple-yet-powerful software for registering geographical data on the field.

All development done from now on will happen here. This migration was needed in order to be able to exploit better community development tools and a distributed versioning system.

BeeGIS got sponsoring from [ARPA Piemonte](http://www.arpa.piemonte.it/).

At the Foss4G in Barcellona a poster about BeeGIS was presented by the ARPA guys. [You can download it here.](http://wiki.beegis.googlecode.com/hg/images/BeeGIS_FOSS4G_2010.pdf)

Development snapshots containing the latest features are made available in the [download area](http://code.google.com/p/beegis/downloads/list). Instruction on how to istall them can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/beegis/wiki/How_to_install_development_snapshots).

Also the [osgeo4w](http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/osgeo4w-setup.exe) project contains the latest BeeGIS packages.
